# Hello Edwin

## The Missing Bridge in DeFAI

The world of finance is experiencing two parallel revolutions. AI frameworks like [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), and [G.A.M.E](https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-python/tree/main) have transformed software development, creating autonomous agents that reason and execute complex tasks. Simultaneously, DeFi protocols like [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), and [Morpho](https://morpho.xyz/) have built an open, programmable financial system managing billions in assets. Yet a critical gap exists - AI frameworks excel at decision-making but lack native DeFi capabilities, while DeFi protocols remain isolated from AI systems. Each protocol speaks its own language, uses unique interfaces, and requires specialized knowledge to integrate, creating a barrier between these two revolutionary technologies.

#### What is Edwin?

Edwin enables AI agents built on top of AI frameworks to interact with DeFi protocols seamlessly. By providing a universal interface and handling blockchain operations securely, **Edwin serves as the infrastructure layer that bridges the gap between AI and DeFi, unlocking the potential of autonomous financial agents - DeFAI.**
