# Security Model

## Core Security Principles

Edwin's security model is built on the principle of security through standardization. By providing a standardized interface for DeFAI operations, Edwin creates a controlled environment where security can be enforced consistently across all protocols and operations.

The protocol whitelisting approach ensures that only vetted and audited protocols can be integrated into the system. This creates a foundation of trust while maintaining the flexibility needed for effective DeFAI operations.

## Security Layers

### Protocol Validation
The first layer of security focuses on protocol-level safety:
- Only whitelisted protocols can be accessed
- Each protocol has defined operation boundaries
- Risk parameters are standardized across protocols
- Protocol health is continuously monitored

### Transaction Safety
Transaction-level security ensures safe execution:
- Transaction amount limits and validations
- Optimized gas strategies
- Built-in slippage protection
- Transaction simulation before execution

### State Validation
State validation is a key area of focus in Edwin's security roadmap. As DeFAI operations become more sophisticated, advanced state validation mechanisms will be introduced to ensure operational safety and risk management.

## AI Agent Boundaries

The Edwin roadmap includes sophisticated boundaries for AI agent operations. Future releases will implement:
- Operation limits based on risk levels
- Built-in threshold checks
- Automated safeguards for risky operations
- Clear operational constraints

## Monitoring and Recovery

The security model includes comprehensive monitoring and recovery mechanisms:
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Automated failure detection
- Clear recovery procedures

Through these layered security measures, Edwin ensures that DeFAI operations remain secure and controlled while maintaining the efficiency needed for effective protocol interactions.
