# edwin cloud

edwin cloud is a managed service layer that simplifies DeFi protocol integration even further. It provides a collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that handle transaction construction, execution, and user context understanding, making it easier for agent builders to integrate with DeFi protocols without the complexity of the full edwin TypeScript library.

## Overview

edwin cloud provides a managed service layer that simplifies DeFi protocol integration through:

* **MCP Server Network**: Distributed network of protocol-specific servers
* **edwin Protocol**: Secure client-server communication protocol
* **edwin-client SDK**: Minimal client library for all programming languages
* **Platform Integration**: Easy integration with any agent framework

## Key Features

* **Protocol Abstraction**: No need to understand individual protocol complexities
* **Transaction Management**: Built-in handling of construction and execution
* **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and error handling
* **Context Understanding**: Server-side intelligence for better transactions
* **Security**: Client-side wallet control with server-side execution
* **Scalability**: Built for high-volume operations

## Benefits

edwin cloud brings significant advantages to all participants in the DeFi ecosystem. For agent builders, it eliminates the complexity of protocol integration by providing a unified interface across all supported protocols. The service handles transaction construction, execution, and error recovery, allowing developers to focus on building innovative strategies rather than managing protocol-specific complexities.

For agent frameworks, edwin cloud offers a seamless integration path that reduces development time and maintenance overhead. The standardized interface and built-in security measures make it easy to add DeFi capabilities to any framework, while the scalable architecture ensures reliable performance as user bases grow.

EDWIN token holders enjoy exclusive benefits, including free access to the service with generous request limits, priority routing for faster transaction processing, and early access to new protocol integrations. They also receive significant discounts on paid tiers and participate in platform governance, helping shape the future of the ecosystem.
